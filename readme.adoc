== Description

[WARNING]
====
Since gitea does not support relative links for asciidoc files, I have used
absolute links instead. This means that they will not work for mirrors.

This repository holds patches that make chromium a more secure browser. These
patches are meant to be used alongside my custom ebuild for chromium, which can be
found in my https://src.reticentadmin.com/aryan/haoyis-gentoo-overlay[overlay].

We are using secureblue's hardened-chromium as a base and including extra
patches and changes on top.
